# Bob Dole Window Manager

_No, **you're** [Bob Dole][]!_

![The man himself, ladies and gentlemen.](img/dole.jpg)

That's right, I'm writing a window manager named after the guy who ran against
Bill Clinton and apparently blinked a lot.  I'm writing it because I want to
use [wmutils][] without worrying about handling the mouse, [swm][] is *too*
simple, and [2bwm][] and friends are a little more than I bargained for.  Also
I'm definitely procrastinating somehow.  At least this is better than porn!
